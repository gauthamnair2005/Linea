# Security and Support

/!\ Support for ProcyoLang will end on November!

## Structure of Update and Support in Linea

* The Linea Programming Language might receive updates any time within 7:00 AM IST to 10:00 PM IST, with no fixed update cycle.
* In the current stage (Beta), any new build released, means the previous build's support is ended, and that particular tag/release will not be fixed or updated.
* However the bugs of previous builds (if found) and features, will be fixed or added in next release tag or build.
* The support for ProcyoLang will end on November, meaning despite being deprecated, it MIGHT receive updates till November.
* After EOL, the ProcyoLang repositories both in my profile and Procyonis Computing Organization profile will be archived.
