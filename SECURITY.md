## Structure of Update and Support in Linea

Starting from Linea 0.5 'Bettafish', we changed the release structure of this project. Now there won't be any branches in the repository and the master branch will be the main branch. The releases will be tagged with the version number and the release name. The release name will be the codename of the release. The first release of Linea 0.5 will be 'Bettafish'. The release starting with 0, is beta and all the alternative numbers will be stable, for example 0.x will be beta or developer release, 1.x will be stable, 2.x will again be beta or developer release and so on.
