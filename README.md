# The Linea Programming Language

(Formerly ProcyoLang)

## What's new in Linea (0.1 Beta 3)? (Why a name change though?)

* Although the syntax remains almost unchanged, it's written from scratch.
* Removed unnecessary code from ProcyoLang 2.0.1 Beta 2.
* Added experimental `lambda` support.
* Improved error handling. (No exception handling!)
